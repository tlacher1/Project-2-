# Project-2 proposal 
This project is designed to enhance ETL ( Extract, Transform, Load) skills. The topic for the project proposal is drug overdose with special emphasis on opioid mortality across thirty three states in United States. Further data will explore the relationship of overdose death rate with race, the prescription rate of opioid, along with change in prescription rate in past one year and five years. 

###Extract
The opioid related open databases will be accessed from Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Medicare and Medicaid services. 

[CDC Data](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/fatal/dashboard/index.html)

[Medicare data](https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-medicaid-opioid-prescribing-rates/medicare-part-d-opioid-prescribing-rates-by-geography/data)

[Medicaid data](https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-medicaid-opioid-prescribing-rates/medicaid-opioid-prescribing-rates-by-geography/data)  

The databases from these three sources will be extracted, transformed, and then uploaded as relational database using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.
