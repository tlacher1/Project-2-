# Project-2 proposal 
This project is designed to enhance ETL ( Extract, Transform, Load) skills. The topic for the project proposal is Opioid drug overdose mortality across various states in United States. Further data will explore the relationship of overdose death rate with the prescription rate of opioid, along with change in prescription rate in past 5 years and one year. The opioid related open databases will be accssed from Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Medicare and Medicaid services. The databases from these three sources will be extracted, transformed, and then uploaded as relational database using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.
